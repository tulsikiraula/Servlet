Servlet Context initialized listener(Loads init parameters and set it to servlet context) 
-> servlet context Attribute listener (A simple implementation to log the event when attribute is added, removed or replaced in servlet context. Triggers when add remve or replace any attribute of servlet context)
->HttpSessionListener (A simple implementation to log the event when session is created or destroyed)
->ServletRequestListener(A simple implementation of ServletRequestListener interface to log the ServletRequest IP address when request is initialized and destroyed).

Servlet API provides following event objects.

javax.servlet.AsyncEvent – Event that gets fired when the asynchronous operation initiated on a ServletRequest (via a call to ServletRequest#startAsync or ServletRequest#startAsync(ServletRequest, ServletResponse)) has completed, timed out, or produced an error.
javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingEvent – Events of this type are either sent to an object that implements HttpSessionBindingListener when it is bound or unbound from a session, or to a HttpSessionAttributeListener that has been configured in the web.xml when any attribute is bound, unbound or replaced in a session.
The session binds the object by a call to HttpSession.setAttribute and unbinds the object by a call to HttpSession.removeAttribute.
We can use this event for cleanup activities when object is removed from session.
javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionEvent – This is the class representing event notifications for changes to sessions within a web application.
javax.servlet.ServletContextAttributeEvent – Event class for notifications about changes to the attributes of the ServletContext of a web application.
javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent – This is the event class for notifications about changes to the servlet context of a web application.
javax.servlet.ServletRequestEvent – Events of this kind indicate lifecycle events for a ServletRequest. The source of the event is the ServletContext of this web application.
javax.servlet.ServletRequestAttributeEvent – This is the event class for notifications of changes to the attributes of the servlet request in an application.
Servlet API provides following Listener interfaces.

javax.servlet.AsyncListener – Listener that will be notified in the event that an asynchronous operation initiated on a ServletRequest to which the listener had been added has completed, timed out, or resulted in an error.
javax.servlet.ServletContextListener – Interface for receiving notification events about ServletContext lifecycle changes.
javax.servlet.ServletContextAttributeListener – Interface for receiving notification events about ServletContext attribute changes.
javax.servlet.ServletRequestListener – Interface for receiving notification events about requests coming into and going out of scope of a web application.
javax.servlet.ServletRequestAttributeListener – Interface for receiving notification events about ServletRequest attribute changes.
javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionListener – Interface for receiving notification events about HttpSession lifecycle changes.
javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingListener – Causes an object to be notified when it is bound to or unbound from a session.
javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener – Interface for receiving notification events about HttpSession attribute changes.
javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionActivationListener – Objects that are bound to a session may listen to container events notifying them that sessions will be passivated and that session will be activated. A container that migrates session between VMs or persists sessions is required to notify all attributes bound to sessions implementing HttpSessionActivationListener.
